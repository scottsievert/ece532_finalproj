## Warmup
1. Derivation not shown (but correct result). 5 points.
2. Why are you changing lambda (and incorrectly)? However, this implementation
   looks to be about right. 5 points.

## Main lab elastic net
1. Evaluation of results is not shown (i.e., prediction accuracy). Also, we
   asked you to write your own code and not use other third party libraries
   (i.e., we didn't ask you to use glmnet) 3 points because it was implemented
   in *some* way.
2. Number of non-zero elements is not analyzed, code not provided. 0 points.
3. It is said which one has the highest accuracy. While the main result is
   stated, no code/source/other accuracies provided. 5 points.
4. Sensible paragraph written. 10 points.

## Main lab group lasso
1. Group lasso implemented (but results not shown). 5 points.
2. Cross validation not implemented, results not provided. 0 points.
3. A kinda sensible paragraph was written. Makes sense, because ridge
   regression does the best (but no numerical results provided). 7 points.

## Feedback, on time
* on time, 5 points
* no feedback, 0 points

Total: 45 points
