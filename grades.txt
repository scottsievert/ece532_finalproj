# Grading
* Graded by: Ian Kinsella, Blake Mason, and Scott Sievert
* (grades for people who completed the lab from group 14)

# Martin Barus:

# Zheng Fan:
##Warmup:
1. 10/10. He correctly derived the pros operator and showed his derivation. 
2. 10/10: He correctly derived the expression and successfully implemented this in code.

##Main lab - Elastic Net:
1. 10/10 Successfully analyzed the importance on lambdas and showed understanding of what the different alphas mean.
2. 7/10: Did not directly address the question but did show understanding about what the question asked.
3. 10/10: Gave a reasonable answer that matches our expectations. 
4. 8/10: Answered the question but the answer provided only half answered the question, but missed the understanding about correlated features. 

##Main Lab - Group LASSO:
1. 10/10: Implemented the code successfully and showed understanding of its function.
2. 10/10: Had a different answer than the sought for answer because there were some errors in his Group Lasso code, but he successfully analyzed these different results.
3. 8/10: Answered the question but missed the overall goal of why youâ€™d want to use elastic net over other L1 of L2 alone.

##Overall:
10/10: Turned in onetime and provided helpful feedback. Student did a good job of this lab.

##Total grade: 93/100: The student understood the overall purpose of that lab and understood the purpose. 

# He Song:
## Warmup
1. Derivation not shown (but correct result). 5 points.
2. Why are you changing lambda (and incorrectly)? However, this implementation
   looks to be about right. 5 points.

## Main lab elastic net
1. Evaluation of results is not shown (i.e., prediction accuracy). Also, we
   asked you to write your own code and not use other third party libraries
   (i.e., we didn't ask you to use glmnet) 3 points because it was implemented
   in *some* way.
2. Number of non-zero elements is not analyzed, code not provided. 0 points.
3. It is said which one has the highest accuracy. While the main result is
   stated, no code/source/other accuracies provided. 5 points.
4. Sensible paragraph written. 10 points.

## Main lab group lasso
1. Group lasso pseudo code written (but results not shown). 5 points.
2. Cross validation not implemented, results not provided. 0 points.
3. A kinda sensible paragraph was written. Makes sense, because ridge
   regression does the best (but no numerical results provided). 7 points.

## Feedback, on time
* on time, 5 points
* no feedback, 0 points

Total: 45 points
